      <h3>Geospatial Analysis Project Overview</h3>
      
      <p>
          This project involves the use of R packages such as <code>sf</code>, <code>raster</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, and <code>leaflet</code> to process and visualize geospatial data. The project includes generating map tiles using <code>gdal</code> and <code>tiler</code> for faster loading, especially when dealing with large raster datasets. An interactive data table was created using <code>DT</code>, allowing users to explore data, select specific areas on the Leaflet map, and download the corresponding raster data.
      </p>
      <p>
          The project makes extensive use of different geospatial data structures, including GeoJSON files, TIFF (GeoTIFF) files, and shapefiles (SHP), to effectively handle and visualize spatial data.

      <p><strong>More About the App:</strong></p>
      <p>
          This site is an interactive archive of Area of Habitats (AOH) for 1,229 small-ranged bird species throughout Central and South America. Here, you may explore summary biodiversity metrics, investigate individual species habitat maps and the data used, and create custom biodiversity richness maps for your area of interest.
