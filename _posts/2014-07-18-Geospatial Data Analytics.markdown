description: |
  This project involves the use of R packages such as sf, raster, ggplot2, and leaflet to process and visualize geospatial data. The project includes generating map tiles using gdal and tiler for faster loading, especially when dealing with large raster datasets. An interactive data table was created using DT, allowing users to explore data, select specific areas on the Leaflet map, and download the corresponding raster data. Below is a video overview of the project:
