        <h3>Emission Reduction in Urban Environments by Replacing Conventional City Buses with Electric Bus Technology</h3>
            <p>
            This project investigates the feasibility and benefits of replacing conventional city buses with Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) in urban environments, using Pakistan as a case study. The research involved developing simulation models in R, conducting financial analysis, and providing policy recommendations to support the transition to electric buses.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study demonstrated that, despite high upfront costs, BEBs could reduce the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by approximately 30% within 6-7 years, along with significantly reducing carbon emissions.
